# PathoBase
An open database for storing and processing the genomes of multiple pathogens, providing genomic information including dcgMLST typing<sup>1<sup/>, genome annotation, and plasmid prediction.

## Quick Start
PathoBase is a database built upon the foundation of the earlier [EnteroBase](https://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/), operated and maintained by the research group of Prof. Zhemin Zhou at Soochow University. It is a fully web-based centralized database, and [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is recommended for access. PathoBase shares the same usage logic as EnteroBase. Therefore, if you have previously used EnteroBase, you should find PathoBase quite familiar.  

The homepage of PathoBase displays available bacterial databases (currently including *A. baumannii*, *A. pittii*, and *S. aureus*) along with an overview of the corresponding bacterial genome counts. You can click on any database to access genomic information for the selected pathogen. However, guest accounts cannot download genome assembly results or create GrapeTree visualizations. We strongly recommend registering and logging in to unlock the full functionality of PathoBase. Let's start with account registration:  

### Registration  
Click the **Register** button in the upper-right corner of the homepage. In the pop-up window, fill in your username, password, email address, and personal information. After completing the required fields, click **Register**. A verification email will be sent to your provided email address. Follow the verification link in the email to complete registration and log in to PathoBase.  

### Login  
Users with existing accounts or those accessing PathoBase via verification credentials can log in by clicking the **Log In** button. Enter your username and password to access most features of PathoBase. We provide a brief tutorial for first-time users, or you may explore the database structure, analysis workflows, and the **dcgMLST + HierCC** algorithm independently.
